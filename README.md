# Developing a Fine-Tuned Solution for Solving Numerical Linear Algebra Problems Using Large Language Models (NLA Project)

This repository presents a research project focused on evaluating, fine-tuning, and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance mathematical reasoning in the domain of **Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA)**.

The project follows a systematic pipeline involving dataset preparation, multi-model evaluation, comparative analysis, domain-specific fine-tuning, and deployment as an application.

## Project Overview

The methodology adopted in this project consists of the following stages:

1. Preparation of an NLA question–answer dataset  
2. Evaluation of multiple baseline LLMs  
3. Comparative analysis using semantic similarity and rank-based metrics  
4. Selection of the best-performing model  
5. Fine-tuning using domain-specific NLA data  
6. Deployment of the fine-tuned model as an application for solving NLA problems

## Models Compared

- OpenAI – **o4-mini**  
- Google – **Gemini 2.5 Pro**  
- DeepSeek – **DeepSeek-R1-0528**  
- xAI – **Grok-3 Mini (Beta)**  
- Custom Fine-Tuned Model – **new_model**  
- Baseline – **Textbook (ground-truth) answers**


---

## Evaluation Methodology

- Cosine similarity for semantic alignment between generated and ground-truth solutions  
- Rank-based evaluation to assess relative model accuracy per question  
- Visualization of performance comparisons across baseline and fine-tuned models  

---

## Outcome

Based on comparative evaluation, the best-performing baseline model is selected and fine-tuned using domain-specific NLA data.  
The fine-tuned model demonstrates improved semantic and structural alignment with expert-annotated solutions and is deployed as an application for solving Numerical Linear Algebra problems.
